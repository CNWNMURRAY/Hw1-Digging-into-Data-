# Hw1-Digging-into-Data-
HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT 
I am using the data I got to see if there is a correlation between abusive landlords, subsidized housing and the availability of alcohol.
ISSUES WITH DATA SETS:
Most of the information I have is out dated. 
Many of the stores sell alcohol however the program only selects stores with liquor in the title so stores like Whole Foods and Mariano's which sell alcohol are not included in the total number of "liquor stores" in the area.
