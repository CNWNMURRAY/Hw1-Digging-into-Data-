# Hw1-Digging-into-Data-
Homework assignment 
I am using the data I got to see if there is a correlation between abusive landlords, subsidised housing and the availability of alcohol.
Issues with dats:
it's old
it's inconclusive: many of the stores listed sell liquor however only the stores with the word liquor in the title were counted.
